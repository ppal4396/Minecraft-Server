### A moment of silence for the old sakura village, iron and gold farms, railway system, hill castle, and plain farms.

To get the new world we started (featuring islands and a hot air balloon) you just need the 'world' folder. You can put it inside your 'saves' folder to play it on single player. You might need to delete the session.lock file.

If you haven't used github before and need help, let me know.
